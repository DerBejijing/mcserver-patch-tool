# mcserver-reversing-toolkit
I use this when reverse-engineering minecraft server code


# About  
Whenever I use decompilers to reverse the minecraft server code to understand its functionality, I want to be able to easily modify the code to add debug stuff, like sysouts. Therefore I wrote this simple bash-script-collection to automate patching and running the server.

# Usage  
For a detailed explaination, please refer to the [USAGE.md](https://github.com/DerBejijing/mcserver-reversing-toolkit/blob/main/USAGE.md).  
NOTE: while I included the new 1.18 versions, a lot has changed in the structure of the server-jar file which makes the scripts useless for these versions. So try using versions below 1.18 until I have come up with a fix.
