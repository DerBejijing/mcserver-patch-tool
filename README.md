# mcserver-patch-tool
I use this when reversing minecraft server code

! UNDER CONSTRUCTION !


# About  
Whenever I use decompilers to reverse the minecraft server code to understand its functionality, I want to be able to easily modify the code to add debug stuff, like sysouts. Therefore I wrote (still writing) this simple bash-script to automate patching and running the server.  


# How to use
Wait until a full release
