# mcserver-reversing-toolkit
I use this when reverse-engineering minecraft server code


# About  
Whenever I use decompilers to reverse the minecraft server code to understand its functionality, I want to be able to easily modify the code to add debug stuff, like sysouts. Therefore I wrote this simple bash-script-collection to automate patching and running the server.
